# Projects developed during my course of learning java
I am Bhagat Sabari Nath. I am a high school student and my github profile conatins projects and exercises that I developed during my grade 11/12 Java course. These projects starts from using the basic understandings that I have built up over the initial few months of learning java, and slowly over time my projects would get more advanced and logical as I further my knowledge of concepts and logic I learn over the course of my life.

### Project 1 Program: iStore

This program demonstrates an online shopping system where users can create an account and purchase Apple products. It begins by welcoming the user and asking whether they already have an iAccount. If not, the program guides them through creating one. The prgram prompts the user to enter their name, email, and password, with password confirmation. After creating an account or confirmation of an existing account, the user is directed to a login page where they must enter valid credentials. After successful login, the initialize() method displays a list of available Apple products with their prices, such as iPhones and MacBooks. The user can then select a product, enter the quantity, and the program calculates the subtotal, tax (13%), and total cost. This program was created during my initial learning of java, and it demonstrates user input handling, conditional logic, loops, and formatted output in Java to create a realistic shopping experience.

### Project 2 Program: Smartphone Info Page

This Program is a portal for viewing smartphone specifications that are available within the program. The program is accessed though the "Smartphone_Info_Page.java" with the main method. Its primary function is to welcome the user and enter a continuous loop that prompts for the desired smartphone brand, such as "Apple" or "Samsung," until the user enters "STOP". The main method handles the initial prompt and input dispatch, and static helper methods like apple() and samsung() for navigating the sub-menus for each brand. When a brand is selected, the corresponding helper method creates an instance of the specific brand's class (Apple.java and Samsung.java) and displays a menu of available phone models, such as the iPhone 16 series or Galaxy S25 series. Upon selecting a model, the brand's object calls its method (e.g.  "apple_iPhone16()" or "samsung_galaxys25Ultra()"), which prints the phone's detailed specifications, price, and then calls the priceConverter method in PriceConverter.java to offer currency conversion. This structure effectively manages the flow of the entire program, guriding the user from the main menu down to the specific information pages. Finally, the program exits gracefully when the user types "STOP."

### Project 3 Program: Tool Shop

This program is effectively a workspace filled with useful tools in the math sector and financial sector. The math sector contains tools like Unit Converter, Roots Calculator, Volume Calculator, and Area Calculator. Unit Converter effectively converts a value from one of the available units to another, and displaying it in the run terminal. The Roots Calculator prompts the user to enter the a,b, and the c value from the Quadratic Formula and then calculates and prints the roots of the quadratic relation, if there are any. The Volume and the Area Calculator prompts the user to enter the required dimensions and then calculates the area or volume. The Financial Sector contains useful tools like Currency Converter, Loan Calculator, and Fuel Economy Cost Calculator. The Currency Converter prompts the user to enter the value of the money and the currency that you are converting from and to. The prgram then displays the converted currency in 2 decimal places. The Loan Calculator prompts the user to enter the principal amount, the interest rate and the time you are borrowing the money. The Program then displays the Monthly payments and then total simple interest at the end of the term. The Fuel Economy Cost Calculator prompts the user to enter the fuel economy in l/100km, the distance that you are travelling, and the current cost of the fuel. The Program then calculates and displays the amount of money spent in the distance travelled. The program also includes 2 games, one is Guess the Random Number, and the other Dice Game. The Guess the Random Number game prompts the user to choose a level, wither easy, medium or hard. It will create a random number between 1 and either 100, 1000, or 10000, depending on the level that the user chooses. The user will recieve 10 tries to guess the number, which hints given after every answer, stating if the number to guess is higher than the one you guessed or lower. The second game, Dice Game requires 2 people to play, and it prompts the user to enter how many rounds they want to play, and then generates a pair of random numbers (to simulate the rolling of two dice) for the number of rounds that the user specified. The game analyzes random numbers and tags them as “consecutive” (worth 2 points), “pairs” (worth 4 points), or “nothing” (worth 0 points). The points are tallied up for the two players and one is declared a winner. This program requires a login to use the tools, with a new system of arrays for managing the usernames and the passwords already in the program and/or if the user wants to create a new account. In this program, a lot of edge cases have been considered and tested, by using try and catch to catch exceptions in case the user enters a string value in the place where a double value must be entered. This program also allows for more flexibility for the user, like if they want to cancel and return to the main menu from whatever they were doing, they can now by entering 0 almost anywhere. The main method for this project is located in [Tool_Shop.java](https://github.com/bhagatsnath/Basic_Projects/blob/main/Project3/Tool_Shop.java)

### Project 4 Program: Toolkit with UI

This Program is similar to the previous Tool Shop Program, but with different features and consists of a User Interface that reveals a friendly design that is easy to interact, where all the buttons are layed out in a way that is similar to other UIs. Every feature has a corresponding instructions sheet, where all the details that a user would need could be found, by reading the welcome screen. The features in this toolkit includes a basic functioning calculator, a currency converter across supporting currencies, a unit converter for distance, mass, speed, and fluid volume across supported units, a number guessing game and many more incoming. The calculator works like a typical calculator with a familiar layout, with all the numbers and operators from a basic non-scientific calculator. This includes decimal points, negative numbers, etc. The Currency Converter contains many possible conversions, where it features Dropboxes where you can select your desired Currency and then hit Convert to show the amount in the currency you want to see in. The Unit Converter contains many possible conversions where it features Dropboxes where you can select your desired Units and then hit Convert to show the value in the units you want to see in. The number guessing game is a guessing game where the game will randomly generate a number based on the level that you choose and you will have 10 attempts to figure out the number. There is an easy level (Guess a number between 1 and 50), a medium level (Guess a number between 1 and 100), and a hard level (Guess a number between 1 and 200). The toolkit includes a settings page that reveals the ability for the user to change the background of the UI, which will change the backgrounds of all the windows of the applications. The time is accessible in the top right corner of the UI, where it displays each numeral with colons and the meridium.
